Slay the Spire - The Faker

This is a mod based on a certain protagonist from a certain franchise.
I like forcing builds, so this mod features cards where that, without compromising on variety, is encouraged.

Currently featuring 101 cards, 4 relics, 1 event, and 2 elite monsters, this mod introduces new mechanics, such as:
- Commands: Basic cards that apply bonus effects when it is the first played card
- Projections: Cards that do not start in your deck but can be accessed to during battle
- Incantation: One card that will gradually become stronger the more often it is used per battle
- Alter: A card transforming each battle becoming progressively stronger during the run
- Endurance: Powers with strong effects as long as you don't take damage
- Saber: A relic bound status/character with separate hit points and energy resource
- True damage: Deal Block-ignoring damage
- Melee stance: Deal more damage with melee cards the less HP you are at
- Range stance: Range cards have HP cost instead of energy now

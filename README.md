Sitting at 100+ cards, it features multiple new mechanics including but not limited to the following:
- Commands: Basic cards that apply bonus effects when it is the first played card
- Projections: Cards that do not start in your deck but can be accessed to regardless
- Incantation: A card gradually becoming stronger the more often it is used per battle.
- Alter: Card transforming each battle becoming progressively stronger
- Saber: A relic bound character with her own hit points and energy resource
- Melee/Range: Two stances with complementary effects
- ...and more e.g. Echo, Endurance, Magic Circuits, Reality Marble, True Damage...
